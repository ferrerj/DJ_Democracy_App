# DJ_Democracy_App
Companion Android App for DJ Democracy project

This app was to facilitate and improve performance of the DJ Democracy webapp. This app was written with Chris Rios for a Software Methodology final project in Spring 2014 utilizing the DJ Democracy server side code which was written solely by John Ferrer.

Functionality should be similar if not the same as the webapp, only written in native Android java.

Known Issues:
Server to connect to through this app is set to 192.168.1.16, but can be set to another address if necessary.
Voting occurs too quickly and the result is not displayed for a discernable amount of time to know if the vote goes through.
